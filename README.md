This is my first Github repository. A Github repostiory can act as a folder, or a building with the apartments within represening different information. This repository project can store many files but it must have a index.html file. We can use these repositories to help store our projects throughout the year, keeping it in a safe place where it can be accessed.

Note: All repositories must have the .github.io extension
